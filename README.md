I'm a former military and a strictly goal-driven person. I am currently working as a security consultant, conducting mostly penetration tests, against a variety of systems, for numerous organizations worldwide.

My main areas of interest are Windows security and malware development, defense evasion, and custom tooling development.

In my spare time, I enjoy cruising through the different nuances of security, while pursuing technical improvement through attendance at training and the acquisition of certifications.
